NOTE: You may need to "Unblock" the BASSMIX.CHM file in its "Properties" to
      view it on Windows 7. The documentation can also be viewed online at
      the BASS website.

NOTE: To run the example EXEs, first you will need to copy BASSMIX.DLL and
      BASS.DLL into the same directory as them.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS API into the same
      directory as the BASSmix API.

NOTE: The Delphi and VB examples may not always be up to date with the C
      examples, so the latter should be preferred as references if possible.

What's the point?
=================
BASSmix is an extension to the BASS audio library, providing the ability to mix
together multiple BASS channels, with resampling and matrix mixing features. It
also provides the ability to go the other way and split a BASS channel into
multiple channels.


Requirements
============
BASS (version 2.4.11 or above) is required.


Using BASSmix
=============
The usage information in the BASS.TXT file (from the BASS package) is also
applicable to BASSmix and other add-ons.

As well as the examples included in this package, several of the examples
included in the BASSWASAPI package also use BASSmix.

TIP: The BASSMIX.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSmix documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.


Latest Version
==============
The latest versions of BASSmix & BASS can be found at the BASS website:
