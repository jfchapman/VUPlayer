Overview
--------
VUPlayer is an open-source multi-format audio player for Windows 7 SP1 or later.
MusicBrainz functionality requires an internet connection.
Audioscrobbler functionality requires an internet connection and a Last.fm account.


Command-line
------------
Ordinarily, VUPlayer stores application settings and metadata in a SQLite database in the user documents folder.
To store this database in the application folder, the following command-line argument can be used to run in 'portable' mode:

	VUPlayer.exe -portable

Please note that, when running in 'portable' mode, database storage requires write permission to the application folder.
